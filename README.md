## My Employee Directory 

* In my application, you will see the user is given a chart filled with potential employees. They will be shown a name, email, phone number, birthday, as well as an image. When deploying, its best to use "npm run start" in the command prompt to run the application. In the making, I had multiple errors and issues when it came to set up with react. All code runs smoothly.
